# Magical_Cloak_Project
Most of us heard about the Harry Potter series. In that series, he used an invisible cloak that made him invisible...! Are you wondering how they made invisible cloaks.....? That’s not as tough as rocket science to build this invisibility cloak.
I am not building it in real way it’s all about graphical tricks with openCV and python to make things invisible in front of webcam.
